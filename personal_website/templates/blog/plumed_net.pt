            <p class="lead">Using Python for data munging and D3 for visualization, I created a graph of the PLUMED
            social network based on Web of Science citations. Each node in the graph represents one researcher who
            has cited <a class="text-primary" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465513003196">
            PLUMED 2</a> at least once. The size of each node corresponds to the total number of times that researcher
            has cited PLUMED 2, and edges denote coauthorship. The largest node corresponds to Michele Parrinello, who has
            cited PLUMED 2 a total of 26 times. Michele Parrinello (one of my academic grandfathers!) is a leader in the
            molecular simulation community, especially in the field of enhanced sampling methods. Along with Alessandro
            Laio, Parrinello proposed the metadynamics enhanced sampling technique in 2002. This method has been advanced
            several times since it was introduced, primarily by researchers mentored by Parrinello. Moreover, the PLUMED
                developers have worked under Parrinello. So this result came as no surprise! </p>

             <p class="lead"> Most of the remote nodes (those not connected to the Parrinello-centric mass in the center of the
                   enhanced sampling universe), represent researchers who have cited PLUMED 2 only once or twice. I would
                   like to see more remote clusters with larger nodes, but I believe the lack of intuitive setup and analysis
                   tools is slowing the PLUMED workflow for groups that are new to enhanced sampling.
                   <span style="font-weight:900">
                       A standardized analysis package and software for automating setup and analysis could
                       expedite the adoption of enhanced sampling techniques by other groups in the molecular modeling community.
                   </span> Someone really oughta do something about that!
